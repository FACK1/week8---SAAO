Week 8 - Express app. 

### What our app is:

Our app's idea revolves around displaying images with descriptions while enabling the user to add images with descriptions of their own. 

### Endpoints:

```
1- 1st end-point / => Home page.
GET request. => respond with html that already has the data attached to it before being sent to the client, then let it call the css once it renders in the browser.

Display images with descriptions/have a form to add your own image.

2- 2nd end-point /add => add images with des.
POST request.
send image to the server.
Server then queries the database.
add an image to db and return a response.
Then redirect to home page with the new posted image. aka ( respond with html that already has the data attached to it before being sent to the client, then let it call the css once it renders in the browser.)

```

### Design

#### Homepage: 

Header: which will have the title of our app, and a form to submit pics of your own.
Section: Where you can browse existing pictures.
Footer: (optional) maybe a copyrights.
